# AGS CSSLib Information
  
check the text file "dropdown info" for information on how to use the dropdown file  
  
please click on, and look at the css to see what it holds  
  
the "ADS_Styles.css" and "ADStudios.css" files are the same, however, the "ADS_Styles.css" file, errored on some adblockers so I recommend using the "ADStudios.css" file
